## Go

Go is statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

In Go, everything is a package. A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. A package can be imported by other packages. `main` is a special package that defines a standalone executable program, not a library.

### Installation

- [Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install Go

### Features

- Garbage collected
- Multithreading
- concurrency

### Packages

- fmt - formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
- os - provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality.
- strconv - implements conversions to and from string representations of basic data types.
- time - provides functionality for measuring and displaying time.
- math - provides basic constants and mathematical functions.
- net/http - provides HTTP client and server implementations.
- encoding/json - implements encoding and decoding of JSON.

#### Strings

- strings.Contains(s, substr) - checks whether a substring exists within a string.
- strings.Fields(s) - splits a string into an array of substrings separated by spaces.

### Hello World - Running a program

```go
package main // package declaration

import "fmt" // import fmt package

import ( "fmt" "os") // import multiple packages

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

We can run and compile the program using the following command:

```bash
$ go run hello.go
```

### Print

Placeholders for `printf` :

- %v - value in default format
- %T - type of value
- %t - boolean
- %d - decimal integer
- %b - binary integer
- %c - character
- %x - hexadecimal integer
- %f - floating point number

Escape sequences:

- \n - newline
- \t - tab

> Examples in `Concepts/1) print.go`

### Variables

- `var` - variables with initializers.
- `const` - declares a constant value. Can't be updated.
- `:=` - short variable declaration. Can be used only inside a function. Called Syntax sugar.

> Examples in `Concepts/2) variables.go`

### Data Types

When we declare with a value we don't need to specify the type. Go will infer the type from the value. But when we declare without a value we need to specify the type.

Eg:

```go
var name string

name = "John"
```

- `bool` - it can be either true or false. Example: `true`
- `string` - string of characters. Example: `"Hello, World!"`
- `int` - integer number. Example: `42`
- `float64` - floating point number. Example: `3.14`
- `uint` - unsigned integer. Example: `42`
- `byte` - alias for uint8. Example: `42`

### Scan

`fmt.Scan` reads text from standard input, scanning the text read into successive arguments. Newlines count as space. It returns the number of items successfully scanned. If that is less than the number of arguments, err will report why.

```go
fmt.Scan(&name)
```

### Pointers

A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

```go
var name = "John"
fmt.Println(&name) // it will print the memory address of the variable name
```

### Arrays

An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type with a fixed length.

We declare an array as follows:

```go
var arr [5]int  // array of 5 integers
```

### Slice

A slice is a segment of an array. It is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

We declare a slice as follows:

```go
var names []int  // slice of integers

names = append(names, 1) // append is a built-in function to add an element to the slice

```

### Loops

In Go, there is only one looping construct, the `for` loop.

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

- `range` - The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

```go
for i, name := range names {
    fmt.Println(i, name)
}
```

- `_` - The blank identifier is a special identifier that is used to ignore values when multiple values are returned from a function. It is used to ignore the index in the above example.

```go
for _, name := range names {
    fmt.Println(name)
}
```

### if else

```go
if num > 0 { // this condition will only be true if num is greater than 0
    fmt.Println("Positive")
} else if num == 0 { // this condition will only be true if num is equal to 0
    fmt.Println("Equal to zero")
} else {   // this condition will only be true if num is less than 0
    fmt.Println("Negative")
}
```

We can check also write `data == false` or `!data`

#### Break and Continue

- `break` - The break statement terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

  ```go

  for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
      if i == 3 {
          break
      }
      fmt.Println(i)
  }
  ```

- `continue` - The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the loop, and resumes execution at the next iteration. It can be used only within an iterative or switch statement and only within the body of that statement.

  ```go
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        if i == 3 {
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
  ```

  ### Switch

  The switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

  ```go
  switch num {
  case 1:
      fmt.Println("One")
  case 2:
      fmt.Println("Two")
  default:
      fmt.Println("Other")
  }
  ```

  ### Functions

  A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is a reusable piece of code.

  ```go
  func add(x int, y int) int {
      return x + y
  }
  ```
