Argo CD is a popular GitOps controller. It is used to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters. It is also used to manage the configuration of the cluster itself. It can be changed too.

- For production we can use the [Autopilot](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot). For a tradational approach we can use the [Manifest directory](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/manifests) approach. Community [Helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/master/charts/argo-cd) charts are also available
