## Concepts
Linux is an operating system like windows and macOS. It is the most popular open source operating system and powers the vast majority of servers that compose the internet. 

Current linux systems contain graphical tools made specifically for an administrator. However, being able to use the interface in the command line mode is crucial for a number of reasons:

* Administration is done by scripts. 
* Aduiting and Debugging is much easier as you can easily look through the logs to track every single action you performed. 
* Remote administration is done on the command line with an SSH terminal.
* It providers more flexibility than GUIs (Graphical user interface).

Thus, learning these commands allows you to connect to a linux terminal and manage resources and file.
