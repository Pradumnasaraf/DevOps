### ⚫ Overview of Linux and Why it is so popular?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that runs on a computer and controls all of the other software and hardware on the computer. Initially, Linux was built on the Unix operating system, which was created many decades ago as a platform for scientific and academic computing. It is used on a wide range of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, cloud computing, and Mobile devices.

As Linux is open-source software so anyone can access its source code and make changes to it. Other than this Linux is known for its Security features. It has a large community of users and developers who are constantly working to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Also, Linux is well known for its Customizability allowing users to modify and configure it in order to meet their specific needs.

### ⚫ Linux Architecture Components

The main architectural components that work together to form a complete Linux OS include Kernel, System Libraries, User Space, Shell, System Utilities, Daemons, and Configuration files.

- Kernel: The kernel is the central part of the Linux OS. It manages the computer's hardware resources and communicates with the software to provide a stable and consistent interface for us.

- System Libraries: System libraries are collections of pre-written code that provides common functions for other programs to use.

- User Space: User space mainly refers to the programs and applications that run on top of the operating system. This includes a wide range of applications such as text editors, web browsers, games, etc.

- Shell: Shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system.

- System Utilities: System utilities are small programs that perform specific tasks such as file management, process management, network management, etc.

- Daemons: Daemons are the background processes that run continuously and perform specific tasks such as network services, log management, etc.

- Configuration files: Configuration files are used to configure various aspects of the Linux operating system such as the network settings, system settings, security settings, etc.

### ⚫ Linux Distributions

Linux distributions, also known as "distros," are different versions of the Linux operating system that are built 
and packaged with specific versions of the architectural components, the package management system used, the graphical user interface, and the tools and applications included in it.

Examples of Linux distros include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Mint, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), etc.
