## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while providing continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is a culture, movement, or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.

If you notice DevOps has a infinity symbol, which means it's a continuous process. It's not a one-time activity. It's a continuous process of development and operations. It's explained in the below image:
