This section contains GitHub workflow configuration files for different scenarios. You can use these files as a reference to create your own workflows.

> :warning: Note: The Actions get outdated quickly, so make sure to check the version of the Actions before using them.


### Creating a Release and Tag

This workflow will create a release and a tag when a push is made to the main branch. Below one was used in a Node.js project, but you can use it in any project with a different language.

Key points:
- `version-file` can be changed or can be completely removed if you don't want to use it.

```yaml
name: Releases and Changelog
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      actions: write
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Conventional Changelog Action
        id: changelog
        uses: TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v5
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          version-file: './package.json,./package-lock.json'

      - name: Create Release
        if: steps.changelog.outputs.skipped == 'false'
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          tag: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.tag }}
          name: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.tag }}
          body: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.clean_changelog }}
```

### Check and Build Go Project

This workflow will check if the code is getting built and formatted correctly. It will also check for linting issues in the code. Can be useful to check incoming PRs.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build-format:
    name: Build and Format
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: 1.22
      - name: Build
        run: go build -v ./...
      - name: Format
        run: diff <(gofmt -d .) <(echo -n)

  golangci-lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: 1.22
          cache: false
      - name: GolangCI-Lint Check
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6
```

### Welcome Message

This workflow will send a welcome message to the contributor when they open an issue, PR, or comment on an issue or PR. You can customize the message as per your requirement.

Key points:
- `issue-message` and `pr-message` can be changed as per your requirement.
- `footer` can be changed or can be completely removed if you don't want to use it.

```yaml
name : Greetings

on:
  fork:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  issues:
    types: [opened]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  welcome:
    name: Welcome Step
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: EddieHubCommunity/gh-action-community/src/welcome@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
          issue-message: "<h3>Hey! contributor, thank you for opening an Issue ðŸŽ‰.</h3>"
          pr-message: "<h3>Hey! contributor, thank you for opening a Pull Request ðŸŽ‰.</h3>"
          footer: "<h3>Thank you for contributing to the project ðŸš€</h3>"
```

### GoReleaser

This workflow will create a tag and release using GoReleaser when a push is made to the main branch. You can use this workflow in your Go project.

Key points:
- `PA_TOKEN` is a personal access token that you need to create in GitHub with `repo` access and write permissions.
- You should have a `goreleaser.yml` file in the root of your project.

```yaml
name: GoReleaser
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  create-tag:
    name: Creating tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Creating Changelog and Release
        id: changelog
        uses: TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v5
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PA_TOKEN }}
          output-file: "false"
          skip-commit: "true"

    outputs:
      tag: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.tag }}

  goreleasers:
    name: GoReleaser
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: create-tag
    # only run if the tag is not empty
    if: ${{ needs.create-tag.outputs.tag != '' }}
    steps:

      - name: Checkout the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5

      - name: Run GoReleaser
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v4
        with:
          distribution: goreleaser
          version: latest
          args: release --clean
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Publish Image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

          tags: | 
            ghcr.io/pradumnasaraf/devops:${{ steps.package-version.outputs.current-version}}
            ghcr.io/pradumnasaraf/devops:latest
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```
