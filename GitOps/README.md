## GitOps

GitOps is a way of managing Kubernetes clusters using Git as the source of truth.

### Benefits of GitOps

- History of changes to the cluster is stored in Git 
- Rollback to a previous version of the cluster is easy
- Changes to the cluster can be reviewed before they are applied
- Changes to the cluster can be tested before they are applied
- Changes to the cluster can be automated

### GitOps Tools

- [ArgoCD](../ArgoCD/README.md) is a git controller that can be used to deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster.
